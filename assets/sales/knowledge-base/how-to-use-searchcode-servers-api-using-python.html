            <p>An example Python program for calling the all of the searchcode server API methods can be found inside the searchcode server source code repository using both <a href="https://github.com/boyter/searchcode-server/blob/master/assets/integration_test/signed_testing.py">SHA1 signed</a> requests and <a href="https://github.com/boyter/searchcode-server/blob/master/assets/integration_test/signed_testing_sha512.py">SHA512 signed</a> requests. These tests are part of the searchcode server test suite and will always be in sync with the current version of searchcode server. As such it is safe to assume that they will always reflect the current state of the searchcode server API.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that both of the above examples modify the searchcode server database directly in order to keep the tests automated. This portion should be removed from your own install.</p>
            <p>To use them you will need admin access to your searchcode server install to generate a valid public/private keypair.</p>
            <p>To see what options are valid for calling the API be sure to check the searchcode server documentation either on this site or in your searchcode server install.</p>
