<p class="em">Designed to be a better grep for source code. As such it includes defaults that make a great deal of sense in that context. Firstly you don't have to specify filenames as it assumes you want to start searching at the current directory and by default will recurse down the file tree. It also will ignore .svn and .git folders assuming (usually correctly) that you have no need to search inside them. Its output is also styled to make searching accross source code easier. Most of its arguments are similar to grep so it is instantly familiar. One really handy feature is being able to include or exclude file types using the --java --nophp syntax. It also ignores known backup files and other such redundant files.</p>

<p class="em">For more performance you can also use the almost compatible version of ag "The Silver Surfer" <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/">http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/</a>  which for most comparable searches is about 5x faster.</p>

<p class="em">As with grep because ack looks at every file and depending on your query every byte in every file it can take a very long time to search across large or multiple code bases.</p>
